Security issues
---------------
If you discover any security issue, please report it
directly to info@zenodo.org (specifically **do not** report it to our GitHub
repository). Please include the the word ``SECURITY`` in all-caps in the email
subject line. We will acknowledge the issue as fast as possible, and keep you
updated on the progress of fixing the issue. We additional ask you
to not publicise the issue until after we have fixed it. After we have fixed
the issue we will publicly open and close an issue in our GitHub repository to
document the issue and publicly credit you for finding it (with your permission
of course).

Help curate Zenodo
------------------
Zenodo is built as a platform for distributed research data curation. We provide CERN's expertise in building/operating large-scale digital repositories as well as big data management and preservation. Zenodo is open to all research, and we therefore need your domain knowledge to help curate content on Zenodo. If you're a publisher, librarian, university, instituion, research group, ... then go create a `Community <http://zenodo.org/communities>`_ and encourage people to submit data to it.

Spread the word
---------------
Happy with Zenodo? Then you can help us spread the word. Tell your colleagues, tweet about, show case your data on Zenodo. We have limited outreach efforts so any help you can provide is greatly appreciated. If you'd like to present Zenodo, feel free to contact us to get inspiration and help. Want us to present, we're happy to give remote webinars if you can gather an audience.
