Zenodo (R)
----------
Zenodo (R) and the Zenodo logo are trademarked by CERN and are not covered
by the GPLv2 license. Thus, if you instantiate Zenodo on your own servers
you must change the branding to your own.

Please consider creating your own overlay to
`Invenio <http://inveniosoftware.org>`_ and look at Zenodo for inspiration.
