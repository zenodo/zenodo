.. include:: ../INSTALL.rst

Development installation
------------------------
If you prefer not to use Docker, you can install Zenodo on your box with a bit
of extra work. Note, however that Docker provides the most similar environment
to the production environment.

First check out the source code:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd ~/src/
    $ git clone https://github.com/zenodo/zenodo.git -b master
    $ cd zenodo

Next, create a virtual environment (using virtualenvwrapper):

.. code-block:: console

    $ mkvirtualenv zenodo
    (zenodo)$

Zenodo works on both on Python 2.7 and 3.3+. However in case you need to use
the XRootD storage interface, you will need Python 2.7 as the underlying
libraries don't support Python 3.3+ yet.

Next, install Invenio extensions and Zenodo itself:

.. code-block:: console

    (zenodo)$ pip install -r requirements.developer.txt \
    --src ~/src/ --pre --exists-action i
    (zenodo)$ pip install -e .[all,postgresql]

Above command will checkout the required Invenio extensions into ``~/src/`` as
well as install Zenodo with PostgreSQL support.

.. note::

   If you already have a checkout of one or more of the extensions, it will be
   left as-is. You are responsible for ensuring that you have the latest
   changes and correct branch in each of these repositories.

Media assets
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Afterwards you need to download and build the media assets for Zenodo. This is
done like this:

.. code-block:: console

   (zenodo)$ source scripts/setup-assets.sh

.. note::

   For the above commands to work you need to have NodeJS, SASS, CleanCSS,
   UglifyJS and RequireJS installed:

   .. code-block:: console

      (zenodo)$ source scripts/setup-npm.sh


Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Next, create the database and Elasticsearch indexes and an admin user:

.. code-block:: console

   (zenodo)$ zenodo db init
   (zenodo)$ zenodo db create
   (zenodo)$ zenodo index init
   (zenodo)$ zenodo fixtures init
   (zenodo)$ zenodo users create info@zenodo.org -a
   (zenodo)$ zenodo access allow admin-access -e info@zenodo.org
   (zenodo)$ zenodo access allow deposit-admin-access -e info@zenodo.org

You must already have PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch 2.x, Redis and RabbitMQ for
above to work.

Demo records
~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can now load the demo records:

.. code-block:: console

   (zenodo)$ celery worker -A zenodo.celery -l INFO --purge
   (zenodo)$ zenodo fixtures loaddemorecords
   (zenodo)$ zenodo migration recordsrun
   (zenodo)$ zenodo migration reindex recid
   (zenodo)$ zenodo index run -d

Badges
~~~~~~
In order for the DOI badges to work you must have the Cairo SVG library and the
DejaVu Sans font installed on your system . Please see `Invenio-Formatter
<http://pythonhosted.org/invenio-formatter/installation.html>`_ for details.
