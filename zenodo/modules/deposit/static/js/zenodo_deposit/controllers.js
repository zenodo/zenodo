// Overriding ui-select's controller to handle arrays
//
// Note: UI-Select by default doesn't play well while being inside an
// array. What happens is that if the array gets modified from the
// outside (eg. delete an array element), the changes are not picked up
// by UI-Select, and thus aren't refelcted on its internal model and
// view. This leads to inconsistent view state for the end user, eg.
// an item from the middle of a ui-select list gets removed using the
// 'X' button, but the view will still display it and remove the last
// item of the list.
//
// The remedy for this issue is to handle the update of ui-select's
// model manually, by overriding its controller.
