<h5>Instructions</h5>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that you fulfil the conditions under which the owner grants access to the upload.</li>
<li>Fill the form, in particular ensure that you provide a proper justification.</li>
<li>Next, you will receive an email with a link to confirm the request. Once you have confirmed the request by opening the link, the owner will be notified.</li>
<li>When the owner either grants/deny access you will receive a notification email. If you are granted access the notification email will contain a secret link that allows you to access the restricted access files.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Who grants/deny access?</h5>
The decision whether to grant/deny access is solely under the responsibility of the record owner. Hence, please note that {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} staff are not involved in this decision.

<h5>What is the response time?</h5>
The response time fully depends on the record owner.

<h5>Can the owner charge me for granting access?</h5>
No, the owner is not allowed to charge you for granting access to the record hosted on {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}}. Please <a href="{{ url_for('zenodo_base.contact')}}">notify us</a> if this happens.
