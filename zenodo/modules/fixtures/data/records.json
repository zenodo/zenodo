As the data coming out of the detectors is increasing continuously that needs to be stored in the data center, we need more physical resources (more money) and since Virtual machines takes lot of CPU and memory overhead and minutes for creating the images, booting up and for snapshotting as well. So here comes the solution to use Docker containers. Docker is an open platform to build, ship and run distributed applications. Docker being a container based virtualisation framework makes use of LXC. Docker containers are lightweight and fast and docker makes use of Union File System which makes it unique. Docker comes with the Docker Index/ Hub where you can store and share the docker images. This project involves the understanding of Docker and docker containers in detail, deployment of private Docker Registry as well as the integration of docker with Openstack to enable the Nova compute service to use the docker API as compute driver instead of the libvirt API.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>\n\n<p>At CERN, with the ever increasing amount of data coming out of the detectors that needs to be stored in the data center, new ways are sought to help analyze and store this data as well as help researchers perform their own experiments. To help offer solutions to such problems, CERN has employed the use of cloud computing and in particular OpenStack\u037e an open source and scalable platform for building public and private clouds. OpenStack is used to view, create, and manage resources in a cloud and automate the tasks. Compute nodes form the resource core of the OpenStack Compute cloud, providing the processing, memory, network and storage resources to run instances. As the data is increasing continuously around 50 PB/sec and about 5 PB/day of data that needs to be stored, CERN is looking for new ways to utilise the hardware resources of the data center more efficiently. In this project we outline and document the integration of Docker with the Nova compute service of OpenStack (Devstack, Packstack), deployment of private Docker Registry at CERN for pushing and pulling the docker images. To allow the Nova compute service to use to the Docker API as compute driver instead of the Libvirt driver and to allow nova to boot the docker images, we need to store the docker images in glance that acts as an independent docker registry after configuration. In this report, we describe about docker, its basics and importance of docker containers in comparison to virtual machines, steps for deploying and configuring the private Docker Registry at CERN and steps for configuring the Nova to use docker driver in Devstack on Ubuntu cloud image and Packstack on RHEL 7.</p>"

To show how SQL-queries can be used to perform basic physics analysis tasks, a C++ macro called &ldquo;SQLPlotter&rdquo; was developed to make ROOT-plots using the output-data from SQL-queries. This project, a web-interface to SQLPlotter basically addresses two major objectives. One objective is to make particle physics analysis more accessible, especially to students who do not have the software skills currently needed to analyse LHC data. Another important aim is to demonstrate the underlying principle of SQLPlotter that SQL queries can be used to perform complex analysis tasks. The web-interface has been implemented using basic web-technologies, including PHP, HTML5 and JavaScript. In future, this web-interface can be envisaged to be brought into production as an educational tool for students interested in physics analysis.</p>",

Some methods, such as instrumentation, are invasive and involve modifications of the profiled binary. This can significantly impact performance, to the point that an instrumented binary runs many times slower than the original. The Performance Monitoring Unit found in many modern processors offers the possibility of low-overhead profiling through a plethora of performance events. In this report, we investigate and quantify this overhead for a variety of tests and configurations, using the &ldquo;perf&rdquo; tool of the Linux kernel. Results for four main usage modes of the PMU are included: counting, sampling, PEBS events, and Last Branch Record (LBR).</p>"

      "description": "<p><strong>Project Specification</strong></p>\n\n<p>Millepede is a multi-threaded detector alignment and calibration software based on the Linear Least Squares Fit algorithm for fitting a large number of parameters (5M+). Developed at DESY, the application is used in many HEP sites, including CERN. Due to computational and memory complexity, the application uses an in-house principle of submatrix partitioning. While this is the way to make the computation feasible, it is not possible to deliver uncertainty for every estimated parameter. The project concerns characterizing the application in terms of parallelization efficiency, including the multi-threading and vectorization aspects. &nbsp;The project was also ported to Intel Xeon Phi, which allowed conducting a performance comparison between Xeon and Xeon Phi.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>\n\n<p>Optimization of a scientific application is not an easy task. It requires a broad knowledge and following a multiple-step methodology. In this work we have characterized and optimized a detector alignment software called Millepede II. We have focused on different performance levels: vectorization, parallelism, memory distribution. Also, the software was ported to Xeon Phi. For the characterization of the application we have used several tools including Intel Advisor and Intel VTune Amplifier.</p>\n\n<p>In this paper we show that there is some room for optimization without introducing massive modifications to the code. We obtain a speed-up of 15% by introducing changes in the code to ease the vectorization and by choosing the right scheduling for each parallel section of the code.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we run the software on Xeon Phi, obtaining not satisfactory results due to the lack of adaptation of the software to the card&rsquo;s hardware.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

      "description": "<p>Project Specification</p>\n\n<p>With the introduction of Puppet configuring machines hosting Oracle databases managed by IT-DB Group of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), it is now much easier to apply any changes and perform the upgrades. Doing so on production environments is always a risk, which has to be addressed, by creating proper test environment. With Oracle Real Application Testing and related features it is currently possible to thoroughly test impact of any change, before implementing it on production and avoid virtually all problems.</p>\n\n<p>The aim of the project is to add a new kind of testing i.e. the Oracle Real Application Testing (RAT) to an existing framework &ndash; DBTest. With the addition of this module, the DBTest framework would be more robust and be more able to detect performance issues in databases due to modifications. The author within the time frame didn&rsquo;t complete the RAT module but has written a significant part of the module. Also, the author made some improvements to the existing framework. Some of the improvements are starting a database before connecting to it, making the reporting of the framework easier to read and also enhancing the error messages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Abstract</p>\n\n<p>Changes occur to production environments regularly and they pose a risk to production. This could be patches to the underlying kernel, migrating to another distribution or an upgrade to the Operating System version. It could also be parameter changes to the database or a change in the vendor. Sometimes, this leads to degradation in the performance of the database. The author extended a framework for database testing by including a module that utilizes a testing tool provided by Oracle &ndash; Real Application Testing. The Real Application Testing (RAT) allows workload of a database to be captured and replayed on a test environment. This document explains the Oracle Real Application Testing then gives a brief overview of DBTest &ndash; a framework that automates testing of databases. After this, the author presents how to use this tool to help detect performance changes in databases.</p>\n\n<p>The result is a tool that makes databases performance testing easy. The author made improvements to the original framework and also wrote the rudimentary code for the Real Application Testing framework. Hence, the original framework, DBTest can now also start databases before connecting to them amongst other improvements. It is the aim of the author that subsequently, the Real Application Testing module can be completed.</p>",

      "description": "<p>Project Specification</p>\n\n<p>The Parameter classes of the ALICE/FAIR (ALFA) software framework contain and manage all the numerical information needed to process the data. In order to analyse the raw or simulated data, several numerical parameters are needed, such as, calibration/digitization parameters or geometry positions of detectors. One common characteristic to most of these parameters is that they will go through several different versions corresponding, for example, to changes in the detectors&rsquo; definition or any other condition. This makes it necessary to have a parameter repository with a well-defined versioning system. The runtime database (Parameter manager in ALFA) is such a repository.&nbsp; It knows about&nbsp; all parameter containers needed for the actual analysis. The containers can be initialized automatically from one or more inputs, and written out to one output. Possible inputs/output mechanisms are ROOT files or ASCII files.</p>\n\n<p>In this project a key-value database will be investigated as an optional IO for the runtime database.</p>\n\n<p>Abstract</p>\n\n<p>In this project, several key-value databases are compared for their performance to implement them into the ALFA framework. As the research shows that a RAMCloud key-value database is not suited for this project, a deep research is done into Riak instead. The case-study compares read vs write latency, optimal simulation sample size, different storage backends, object size influence, cluster size influence, different consistency settings and there performance impact, the impact of adding security, the overhead of using a Java tool and the availability and fault tolerance of Riak. All these measurements are discussed taking into account certain difficulties of simulating a key value database. This gives us a document showing the impact of certain design decisions in implementing a key-value store and will allow developers for future projects to easily ascertain how changes in the database will impact performance and how to easily use a tool developed during this project to make exact measurements.</p>",

In order to ensure fast access, EOS keeps a representation of the namespace in RAM along with a change-log file on disk.

Migration of the namespace to persistent memory (non-volatile RAM or NVRAM) will ensure persistence of data even in the event of a sudden power cut, as well as a considerable improvement on boot-up time. However, this migration requires that changes to the memory are done in a <em>transactional</em> fashion; in the event of a crash, we would like to recover with a consistent view of the namespace.</p>\n\n<p>We present a hashtable that can be used to store contents persistently and transactionally, for use with the Mnemosyne[2] toolchain.

Finding the popular datasets is helpful in a two-fold way. Firstly, it helps in providing expeditious access to datasets that might be required and secondly, it helps in finding which might become the &lsquo;hot topics&rsquo; in high energy physics. It is also necessary to define what a popular dataset is. Based on the data collected, some parameters such as nusers, naccesses and tot_cpu can be said to define popularity because the curve between all the parameters and popularity is mostly dependent on them. To find the numerical value of the threshold limit beyond which a dataset is termed popular, a graph is plotted. This graph is plotted on the log scale so that all values can be plotted within the region represented by the graph.</p>\n\n<p>After calculating the threshold values, transformation into a classification problem is done. Now, a rolling forecast is performed. This helps us to predict binary popularity values for each week. Each week&rsquo;s data is added to the existing data and a new model is created. This follows the notion, more data leads to better data analysis. Prediction can be done in various ways following implementation of several machine learning algorithms, mainly, Naive Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent and Random Forest. Their models are then combined into an ensemble to check which algorithm offers the best true positive, true negative, false positive or false negative value.</p>\n\n<p>This project also includes plotting the results obtained against the time scale to get a notion of how accuracy scores change with each week. These include sensitivity, specificity, precision, and recall and fallout rate against time scale.&nbsp;</p>",

      "description": "<p>Project Specification</p>\n\n<p>Basic Systems Monitoring</p>\n\n<p>This is now done with a CERN-made custom collector which sends data in the form of &quot;notifications&quot; via Apache Flume to HDFS for long-term storage. The notifications are also sent to ElasticSearch and displayed with Kibana (a\u0300 la Splunk). Due to limitations of the architecture, the system data is collected every 5 minutes which is not ideal.</p>\n\n<p>The idea is to implement a solution which allows more fine-grained sampling of system metrics. Possible ideas are OpenTSDB (to leverage the existing Hadoop infrastructure) or prometheus.io, which should be simpler to setup but it only scales out by sharding. OpenTSDB initially seems like a more promising solution, so investigate the various collection and display alternatives.</p>\n\n<p>Logs Management and Centralisation.</p>\n\n<p>This is now done only for syslog with Apache Flume - shipping to HDFS (and kept &quot;forever&quot;) and to Elasticsearch/Kibana, with a 1 month retention time. There are two issues: flexibility of the collection process, and authorisation.</p>\n\n<p>On the flexibility side, collected messages need to be split into different fields before being stored in HDFS/Elasticsearch, in order to ease the data mining process. Logstash and grok are potentially promising solutions.</p>\n\n<p>On the authorisation side, the idea here is to specifically target the Weblogic installations in order to expose to clients their application logs in a convenient way, and as we host very different applications with different confidentiality levels (amazing what can be found in some application logs!) we need to put an authorisation layer on top of HDFS and ElasticSearch (Kibana just being JS querying ElasticSearch directly). For this there are some methods that could be implemented on HDFS, and for ElasticSearch there is a FOSS plugin to be checked. This part would probably involve setting up an ElasticSearch cluster first.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Abstract</p>\n\n<p>There are a number of problems with the current monitoring infrastructure in IT-DB which currently make it difficult to diagnose certain system issues. These include lack of support for certain log formats, latency in messages, and inflexibility of architecture. Several changes to the log monitoring service architecture were evaluated over the period of several weeks, focusing on improving performance, verbosity, and reducing latency. Additionally, several changes to the metric monitoring architecture were evaluated, including deploying a new time-series database to test performance and latency. There were also a number of extra tests conducted on third-party visualisation dashboards and Elasticsearch security software. The proposed log monitoring architecture was found to be useful, and will be the subject of further development and evaluation. The proposed metric monitoring architecture was also found to be useful, but needs further investigation to decide if it is a significant enough improvement over the current architecture to be of value. There were also several software packages found to be unsuitable or unstable, and these are not used in the proposed system architectures. The evaluation was largely successful as much of the work was either found to be unsuitable or will be the subject of further development.&nbsp;</p>",

Also this benchmark framework is generic in the sense that this upgraded benchmark framework can be used for measuring the scalability of other storage technologies at CERN like Kinetic Drives or EOS.</p>\n\n<p>As a part of the Data and Storage Services group of the IT department (IT-DSS) at CERN, the task was to upgrade the cloud storage benchmark framework and run the existing tests on the upgraded benchmark.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Abstract</p>\n\n<p>The European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) is the largest research center in the world in the field of particle physics. Huge amounts of data, in the order of Peta Bytes, are being generated from the High Energy Physics experiments going on at CERN. The massive data growth prompts CERN to evaluate new storage technologies, to store and analyse the data that is being generated from the experiments. The scalability of the storage system is important for CERN as the laboratory faces the ever increasing demands of its physics users.</p>\n\n<p>Huawei, a CERN collaboration member, focuses on investigating the applicability of new storage techniques and architectures to the storing of high energy physics data from the LHC e\udbff\udc00peri\udbff\udc01e\udbff\udc02ts.

Since its most recent release Icehouse, the OpenStack platform includes a new component, named Trove, which provides Database as a Service functionalities. Thus, the main goal of the project is to evaluate this component, OpenStack Trove, from the point of view of the feasibility of using it as a resource provider for the Database on Demand service. With this objective, some major points of interest are: the current status and maturity of the Trove project, ability to support additional database types, and compatibility with Scientific Linux as the computing platform running most CERN services. A secondary goal of the project is to evaluate different Java interfaces to OpenStack which would enable the service&rsquo;s software to interact with the OpenStack service to create and manage instances for the database servers.</p>"

Additionally, a pilot service based on <em>HTCondor </em>is currently being set up. In a batch system the worker nodes are shared among the users over time. The central batch service uses <em>fair-share </em>scheduling, which ensures that, over a historic time window, a group of users can use the capacity (<em>share</em>) that is assigned to them. Each share on the system is allocated to a group of users. Compute coordinators can delegate capacity, as well as the control of this capacity to subgroups. This situation is shown in figure 1.</p>"

      "description": "<p><strong>Abstract&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>This project deals with two aspects of improving the file transfer service &ndash; FTS3. The first one is the selection of best source site for file transfers. Since files are replicated at different sites, the selection of the best source site based on the networks throughput and success rate can have a major impact on FTS3. The second one is maximizing the file throughput across WLCG network by increasing the TCP buffer sizes. TCP is the only transport layer protocol used widely for data transfers; it was originally designed with focus on reliability and long-term fairness. In high bandwidth networks, the system administrators have to manually optimize/tune the TCP configurations. Some of these configurations have a major impact on throughput. TCP buffer size is one such setting, which sets a limit on TCP congestion window size. With the release of Linux Kernel 2.6, a new feature &ldquo;Linux TCP Auto-Tuning&rdquo; was introduced, which selects the optimal TCP buffer sizes based on system resource usage. Another way to increase the TCP buffer size is to use setsocketopts system call. Since FTS3 implements gridFTP protocol, it gives us the flexibility to set TCP buffer sizes manually. This project evaluates the pros and cons of different techniques for setting TCP buffer sizes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Keywords: FTS3, TCP , Linux TCP Auto-Tuning&nbsp;</p>",

The main goal of the project was to create a testbed for cloud federation for performing federation tests with multiple Identity Providers at the same time and test them with both browser and CLI (Command Line Interface). At the beginning this report gives a general overview of the main concepts on which the project is based, with particular reference to Keystone, the OpenStack Identity Service, describing its main features and how it works. Later are described the protocols and the open source solutions and products (Shibboleth SP, Shibboleth IdP, Shibboleth EDS, ADFS) used for the creation and testing of the testbed. In the following chapters is documented step by step the testbed&#39;s configuration. This is the main part of the report and it gives the details of how to install OpenStack and configure its Identity Service running in HTTPD with Shibboleth Service Provider. Then is described how to federate each Identity Provider with Keystone Identity Service providing the main configuration files. The last part describes the testing in which each Identity Provider has been tested both via CLI (ECP - Enhanced Client or Proxy) and via web browser in order to receive from Keystone a token with which the end user could perform some OpenStack operations.</p>"

It is meant to allow developers to build and deploy their applications in a uniform way, reducing the configuration and management effort required on the administration side. The aim of the project is to investigate how to deploy OpenShift Origin at CERN, and to which extent it could be integrated with CERN &quot;Middleware on Demand&quot; service. The student will be exposed to modern cloud computing concepts such as PaaS, and will work closely with the IT middleware experts in order to evaluate how to address service needs with a focus on deployment in production. Some of the tools that are going to be heavily used are Puppet and Openstack to integrate with the IT infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>\n\n<p>The report is a brief summary of Platform as a Service (PaaS) solutions evaluation including investigation the current situation at CERN and Services on Demand provision, homemade solutions, external market analysis and some information about PaaS deployment process. This first part of the report is devoted to the current status of the process of deployment OpenShift Origin at existing infrastructure at CERN, as well as specification of the common issues and restrictions that were found during this process using different machines for test. Furthermore, the following open source software solutions have been proposed for the investigation of possible PaaS provision at CERN:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>OpenShift Online;</li>\n\t<li>Cloud Foundry;</li>\n\t<li>Deis;</li>\n\t<li>Paasmaster;</li>\n\t<li>Cloudify;</li>\n\t<li>Stackato;</li>\n\t<li>WSO2 Stratos.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>CERN &lsquo;homemade&rsquo; solution called Middleware Manager Service was also examined as well as series of proprietary software to compare the features and possibilities of integration. The second part of report contains information about Cloud Foundry PaaS solution and about the process of its deployment at CERN.</p>"

The data throughput will increase from the currently used 400 Gbit&nbsp;per second to astonishing 40 Tbit. The LHCb upgrade team built two FPGA boards:&nbsp;AMC40 and PCIe40 (see image 1.1). The AMC40 board has an Ethernet interface,&nbsp;produces UDP packets and sends them over the network. The PCIe40 board sends data&nbsp;over PCIe to a server, which in turn creates the network packets based on the PCIe data&nbsp;received, and sends them over the network. Each board is connected to the detectors&nbsp;and contains an FPGA, which does the preprocessing of the data received from the&nbsp;detector. The readout system is connected to the network and sends network packets&nbsp;to the backbone (see image 1.2). The readout system will operate at an overall speed of&nbsp;around 40 Tbit/s. In order to have a means of debugging all this network traffic, tools&nbsp;are necessary. The implementation of such a tool is the task for this Openlab Summer&nbsp;Student project.</p>",

As most of the control systems used in CERN are developed in WinCC OA, it is better useful to understand how the applications developed by EN/ICE are actually used by the different operators .It becomes more and more important to monitor users&rsquo; behavior and analyzing it. The final goal of this project is to develop a generic WinCC OA component to collect data about user interaction which will take advantage of (1) the internal mechanisms already present in WinCC OA to monitor some user interactions such as the internal UI data points; and (2) the commonalities of applications through the use of the standard frameworks JCOP, UNICOS and CPC. The final component developed provides the capability of storing as well as displaying user interaction data on a single timeline.</p>\n\n<p>Keywords: WinCC OA, SCADA, JCOP, UNICOS, CPC</p>",

All the benchmarks are fully automated to generate results from running binaries compiled by three compilers: GCC, ICC and Clang with -O2, -O3 and -Ofast options. In order to evaluate vectorization and multithreading, profiling tools such as perf and Intel Vtune are used.</p>",

Part of the Data &amp; Storage Services (IT-DSS) group&rsquo;s work at CERN is focused on testing and evaluating the cloud storage system that is provided by the openlab partner Huawei, Huawei Universal Disk Storage System (UDS). As a whole, the system consists of both software and hardware.<br />\nThe objective of the Huawei-CERN partnership is to investigate the performance of the cloud storage system. Among the interesting questions are the system&rsquo;s scalability, reliability and ability to store and retrieve files. During the tests, possible bugs and malfunctions can be discovered and corrected. Different versions of the storage software that runs inside the storage system can also be compared to each other.<br />\nThe nature of testing and benchmarking a storage system gives rise to several small tasks that can be done during a short summer internship. In order to test the storage system a test framework developed by the DSS group is used. The framework consists of various types of file transfer tests, client and server monitoring programs and log file analysis programs. Part of the work done was additions to the existing framework and part was developing new tools. Metrics collection was the central theme. Metrics are to be understood as system statistics, such as memory consumption or processor usage.<br />\nMemory usage and disk reads/writes were added to the existing client real-time monitoring framework. CPU and memory usage, network traffic (bytes received/sent) and the number of processes running are collected from a client computer before and after a daily test. Two other additions are visualization for storage system log files, as well as a new monitoring tool for the storage system. This report is divided into parts describing each part of the framework that was improved or added, the problem and the final solution. A short description of the code and the architecture are also included.</p>",

These statistics are currently displayed by SLS (Service Level Status) or Lemon pages. They also use the Web interface provided with OpenTSDB, a DB optimised for time series. And while these various pages give very useful and technical information, they do not always emphasise the important figures. Having different statistics pages makes it difficult to see the relevant numbers at once. The goal of this project was to build homogeneous dashboards with interactive plots to better reflect the activity and resources of each service, showing relevant figures at first sight in a single website.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />\nThere is a need in the IT-PES-PS section to improve the current situation of having to consult the relevant information from several heterogeneous websites by introducing interactive homogeneous dashboards, accessible from a single web application where the information needed can be quickly accessed. The goal of this openlab Summer Student project was to create a website with homogeneous and interactive dashboards. Its architecture had to allow the creation of new dashboards easily.</p>",

      "description": "<p>The new release of Oracle 12c contains new features which satisfy continuously growing needs demands for resources. Large enterprises nowadays may use hundreds or thousands of databases combined with different platforms on multiple physical servers. Because of improvements in hardware technology, especially the increase in the number of CPUs, servers are able to handle heavier workloads than before. A database may use only a fraction of the server hardware capacity, which can waste hardware resources.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>To show the problem in reduced scale, Figure 1depicts 11 databases, each with its own application and server. A head DBA oversees a team of four DBAs, each of whom is responsible for two or three databases.</p>\n\n<p>One possible solution to the problem is to consolidate data from multiple databases into one database on one computer which is known as database consolidation. Database consolidation is feasible by using new features proposed by Database 12c Release, i.e. Multi-tenant Environment and Pluggable Databases. Multi-tenant environment of Oracle, also, offers a path-breaking technology that delivers &ldquo;Database as a service&rdquo;. Database as a Service (DBaaS) is a paradigm where end users (DBAs, Developers, QA Engineers, Project Leads, etc.) can request database services, consume it for the lifetime of the project, and then have then automatically de-provisioned and returned to the resource pool.</p>\n\n<p>The final goal of this project is to investigate and test the aforementioned features in practise. In the following chapters, we implemented a few test cases related to Pluggable Databases both in Oracle Enterprise Manager12c (EM12c) and SQL Plus environments. These use cases include topics related to users, manipulation of databases and database locations.&nbsp; It is studied the paradigm to make a request for a &ldquo;Database as a Service- DBaas&rdquo; and the necessary steps are described combined with the possible alerts or problems faced and resolved.&nbsp; In chapter 3.5, we have a presentation about the integration of Oracle VM Manager and Oracle Enterprise Manager 12c and a comparison is made between these two tools During this project, some scripts were developed to ease managing of both databases and related users. These support scripts are described in chapter 4.&nbsp;</p>",

While in small conferences it is easy to keep track of participants with a simple paper list, such techniques become inefficient when the need to scale the process up arises. Therefore Indico&rsquo;s participant registration module would be extended with the functionality to generate electronic tickets. This will allow conference organizers to keep track of attendees after they finish the registration process. As part of this project it is also necessary to develop a mobile application that will be used to scan the electronic tickets, identify the user and mark them as checked in when they arrive at the conference. Additionally Indico&rsquo;s HTTP API would be extended to be used by the mobile application to retrieve data about conferences and attendees.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />\nThe main goal of this project is to simplify the check-in process for conferences that use the Indico conference management system. This is archived by extending Indico&rsquo;s core to include electronic ticket generation functionality and developing a mobile application that is used to scan the electronic tickets during the check-in process. Indico&rsquo;s HTTP API is also extended to provide the mobile application with the necessary data.</p>",

In order to authenticate against a SQRL aware service, one has to use the SQRL application on his phone. A perk of using SQRL is that the users only need to remember a master password for the SQRL application itself rather than passwords to all the different authentication services they use.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>U2F, on the other hand, is hosted by the FIDO alliance. It has been adapted by big companies, such as Google, Visa, Yubico, etc. It requires a physical U2F enabled token on the client side and a U2F aware authentication service on the server side.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>After an evaluation of the two protocols, we have come to a conclusion that at this point, U2F is a better option than SQRL. Hence, a web application has been implemented and deployed on CERN web servers to demonstrate the functionality of U2F.</p>",

This project involves the<br />\nconfiguration, deployment and testing of OpenStack Cinder as well as the integration<br />\nwith other block storage alternatives such as NetApp and Ceph. A performance analysis and comparison between these storage mechanisms will be<br />\nundertaken to determine the most suitable for use at CERN. Furthermore, modifications will also be made to OpenStack to allow user-specified Ceph data striping values to be set during volume creation as well as the Ceph/QEMU caching method upon volume attachment to an instance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />\nWith the ever increasing amount of data produced from Large Hadron Collider (LHC)<br />\nexperiments, new ways are sought to help analyze and store this data as well as help<br />\nresearchers perform their own experiments. To help offer solutions to such problems,<br />\nCERN has employed the use of cloud computing and in particular OpenStack; an open source and scalable platform for building public and private clouds.<br />\nThe OpenStack project contains many components such as Cinder used to create block storage that can be attached to virtual machines and in turn help increase performance.However instead of creating volumes locally with OpenStack, others remote storage clusters exist offering block based storage with features not present in the current OpenStack implementation; two popular solutions are NetApp and Ceph.<br />\nTwo features Ceph offers is the ability to stripe data stored within volumes over the<br />\ndistributed cluster as well as locally cache this data, both with the aim of improving<br />\nperformance. When in use with OpenStack, Ceph performs default data striping where<br />\nthe number and size of stripes is fixed and cannot be changed dependent on the volume to be created. Similarly, Ceph does not perform data caching when integrated with OpenStack.<br />\nIn this project we outline and document the integration of NetApp and Ceph with<br />\nOpenStack as well as benchmark the performance of the NetApp and Ceph clusters<br />\nalready present at CERN. To allow Ceph data striping, we modify OpenStack to take the number and size of stripes input via the user to create volumes whose data is then striped according to the values they specify. Similarly, we also modify OpenStack to enable Ceph caching and allow users to select the caching policy they require per-volume. In this report, we describe how these features are implemented.</p>",

Its goal is to form a federated Cloud Computing infrastructure that will satisfy the growing demand of scientists for computing power. The concept of the federated cloud requires a standard framework named BlueBox so that current and future cloud providers are able to smoothly interface their system to the existing multi-cloud infrastructure. Section one acts as an introduction to the reader, highlighting the importance of cloud computing in general and at CERN specifically, and provides a brief overview of the Helix Nebula initiative. Section two contains information about the functionality and performance of SlipStream, an interface that has been evaluated as a potential BlueBox solution. Section three contains the analysis of a de facto standard in cloud computing such as the EC2 interface, which is very useful for Helix Nebula and multi-cloud environments in general. Finally, in section 4, you may find listed the key conclusions about SlipStream, based on the evaluation that was carried out along with several other remarks about multi-cloud operations.&nbsp;</p>"

      "description": "<p><strong>Abstract&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>The report presents a short overview on what OpenStack is, how and why is it used at CERN and also goes into detail about the OpenStack Manila component, a service that enables file based storage and file sharing within OpenStack virtual machines.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>OpenStack Manila is a relatively new OpenStack component, having started in 2012 and in 2014 it has reached the latest cycle of development, where it could still be found at the time of the report. The fundamental object Manila works with is the &lsquo;share&rsquo;, a unit of storage that can be accessed through the network simultaneously by multiple users. The scope of Manila is to provision shares in a &lsquo;Shares-as-a-Service&rsquo; fashion, allowing entrusted users to manage their own shares independently, without the need of any external assistance, such as from an admin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The scope of the project has been to experiment with this technology and assert its functionality in the context of the existing cloud at CERN. The report details the principal services and operation of OpenStack Manila, along with the most common used command lines. It also goes into detail about two ways in which Manila can be installed, either manually or by using a deployment automation tool. A look at the required configuration parameters is also presented.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In the last part, the deployed Manila service at CERN is presented, together with the configuration options used for the backend, the part responsible with linking the Manila service to the actual storage platform used.&nbsp;</p>",
