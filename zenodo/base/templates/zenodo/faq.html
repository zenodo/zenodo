<ul>

    <li>
        <h5>What are the size limits in {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}}?</h5>
        <p>We currently accept files up to 2GB (you can have several 2GB files per upload); there is no size limit on communities.  However, we don't want to turn away larger use cases. The current infrastructure has been tested with 10GB files, so possibly we can raise the file size limit per community or for the whole of {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} if needed.  If you would like to upload larger files, please <a href="{{url_for('zenodo_base.contact')}}">contact us</a>, and we will do our best to help you.  Please be aware that we cannot offer infinite space for free, so donations from heavy users towards sustainability are encouraged. Since we target the long-tail of science, we want public user uploads to always be free.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>What can I upload?</h5>
        <p>All research outputs from all fields of science are welcome. In the upload form you can choose between types of files: publications (book, book section, conference paper, journal article, patent, preprint, report, thesis, technical note, working paper, etc.), posters, presentations, datasets, images (figures, plots, drawings, diagrams, photos), software, videos/audio and interactive materials such as lessons. We do check every piece of content being uploaded to ensure it is research related. Please see further information in our <a href="{{url_for('zenodo_base.terms')}}">Terms of Use</a> and <a href="{{url_for('zenodo_base.policies')}}">Policies</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>Is {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} only for EU-funded research?</h5>
        <p>No. We are open to all research outputs from all fields of science regardless of funding source. Given that {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} was launched within an EU funded project, the knowledge bases were first filled with EU project codes, but we are keen to extend this to other funders with your help.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>How do you plan to secure ongoing funding for {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}}?</h5>
        <p>{{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} is still in its infancy, so whilst this is a good question to ask, we donâ€™t have just one definitive answer since we are exploring several avenues as we mature our services. {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} was launched within the <a href="http://www.openaire.eu">OpenAIREplus</a> project as part of a Europe-wide research infrastructure. OpenAIREplus will deliver a sustainability plan for this infrastructure with an eye towards future Horizon 2020 projects and is thus one of our possible funding sources.  Another possible source of funding is CERN itself. CERN hosts and develops several large services, such as <a href="http://cds.cern.ch">CERN Document Server</a> and <a href="http://inspirehep.net">INSPIRE-HEP</a>, which run the same software as {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}}.  Additionally, CERN is familiar with preserving large research datasets because of managing the Large Hadron Collider data archive of 100 petabytes.  As you can see, our sustainability plan is still in development, but we are fully dedicated to delivering an open service and preserving your research for the future.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>Is my data safe with you / What will happen to my uploads in the unlikely event that {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} has to close?</h5>
        <p>Yes, your data is stored in CERN Data Center. Both data files and metadata are kept in multiple online replicas and are backed up to tape every night. CERN has considerable knowledge and experience in building and operating large scale digital repositories and a commitment to maintain this data centre to collect and store 100s of PBs of LHC data as it grows over the next 20 years. In the highly unlikely event that {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} will have to close operations, we guarantee that we will migrate all content to other suitable repositories, and since all uploads have DOIs, all citations and links to {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} resources (such as your data) will not be affected.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>What does it cost? /Can we pay for Zenodo services? </h5>
        <p>{{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} is free for the long tail of Science. If you are interested in preserving a large amount of resource hungry research, please <a href="/contact">contact us</a>, and we will be happy to discuss expanding upload limits and our operation costs/capacity. Donations are always welcome.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>Really, who pays for this?</h5>
        <p>{{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} is developed by <a href="http://www.cern.ch">CERN</a> under the EU FP7 project <a href="http://www.openaire.eu">OpenAIREplus</a> (grant agreement no. 283595).</p>

    <li>
        <h5>Why is my upload not on the front-page?</h5>
        <p>All uploads go through a quick spam check by our staff prior to going on the front-page.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>Why is my closed access upload not on the front-page?</h5>
        <p>{{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} is a strong supporter of open data in all its forms (meaning data that anyone is free to use, reuse, and redistribute) and takes an incentives approach to encourage depositing under an open license. We therefore only display Open Access uploads on the front-page. Your Closed Access upload is still discoverable through search queries, its DOI, and any community collections where it is included.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>Why do you allow closed access uploads?</h5>
        <p>Since there isn't a unique way of licensing openly and nor a consensus on the practice of adding attribution restrictions, we accept data under a variety of licenses in order to be inclusive. We will, however, take an active lead in signaling the extra benefits of the most open licenses, in terms of visibility and credit, and offer additional services and upload quotas on such data to encourage using them. This follows naturally from the publications policy of the <a href="http://www.openaire.eu">OpenAIRE initiative</a>, which has been supporting Open Access throughout, but since it aims to gather all European Commission/European Research Area research results, it allows submission of material that is not yet Open Access.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>What happened to the OpenAIRE Orphan Record Repository?</h5>
        <p>OpenAIRE Orphan Record Repository got a make-over and was re-branded as {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}}. If you deposited your article in OpenAIRE Orphan Record Repository, it is also available in {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}}. However, your user account was not transferred to {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}}, so you will have to <a href="{{url_for('youraccount.register')}}">register</a> again. If you register with the same email address in {{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} as you used in OpenAIRE Orphan Record Repository, you will still have access to your publications. Don't hesitate to <a href="{{url_for('zenodo_base.contact')}}">contact us </a>for further information.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>Where does the name come from?</h5>
        <p>{{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} is derived from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenodotus">Zenodotus</a>, the first librarian of the Ancient Library of Alexandria and father of the first recorded use of metadata, a landmark in library history.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h5>How much digital storage-space does CERN have available?</h5>
        <p>{{config.CFG_SITE_NAME}} is currently a drop in the ocean. CERN stores more than 100PB (petabytes) of physics data from the <a href="http://home.web.cern.ch/about/accelerators/large-hadron-collider">Large Hadron Collider (LHC)</a>, and produces roughly 25PB per year when the LHC is running.</p>
